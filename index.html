					<h2>World GDP 2023</h2>
					<p>
						GDP is the financial pulse of a nation, offering a vital peek into
						its economic vitality and overall prosperity. It's not just a
						number; it's a window into the well-being of a country. Higher GDP
						per capita signifies a robust economy with ample job opportunities,
						akin to a bustling job marketplace.
					</p>
					<div id="choropleth_map" class="map-container"></div>
					<p>
						High GDP in North America, Western Europe, and Oceania stems from
						strong institutions, an educated workforce, modern capital, and
						entrepreneurial vigor. Western countries, with affordable education
						for the masses, stable politics, and inviting policies, attract
						investors and talent, leading to robust economies and high GDP
						figures.
